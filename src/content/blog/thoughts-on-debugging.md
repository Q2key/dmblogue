There is something deeply humbling about debugging. You write code with confidence, hit run, and then — silence, or worse, an error that makes no sense at all.

But that moment when it finally clicks? When you realize the bug was a single misplaced character, a wrong assumption, or a timing issue you never considered? That feeling is hard to describe. Relief, yes. But also a strange kind of joy.

Debugging teaches you that software is not magic. It is logic, layered on top of logic, layered on top of assumptions. When something breaks, one of those layers is lying to you. Your job is to find out which one.

The best tool you have is not a debugger or a linter. It is patience.

Keep going. The bug is always there, waiting to be found.
