## Slow is smooth, smooth is fast

There is a saying in the military: *slow is smooth, smooth is fast*. I have been thinking about this a lot lately while working on side projects.

We live in a culture that celebrates shipping fast, moving fast, and breaking things. But I keep coming back to the idea that speed without intention just creates more chaos to clean up later.

### What I am learning

When I rush a feature, I usually end up:

- Writing code I don't understand a week later
- Skipping tests because "it's obvious it works"
- Accumulating tech debt that slows everything down

When I slow down and think first:

- The solution is usually simpler
- I catch edge cases before they bite me
- The code is easier to explain to others (and to future me)

### A small experiment

This month I tried spending 10 minutes planning before writing any code. Not formal specs, just a rough sketch in a notes file. The result? I shipped faster. The planning time was paid back immediately in fewer wrong turns.

Try it. Go slow on purpose, just once.
